# Redefining Blackboard with p5.js
## ART 151 Final Project - Spring 2024 : The website probes the question of what constitutes art? 

Drawning inspiration from Natural Process by Exonemo, the piece works on displaying the Google homepage as an oil painting. This led me to think about how what we consider as a utility and how we decide what is art and what is not. Thus, I decided to take a website that can be considered as the farthest thing from art, purely a utility which is Blackboard - a learning tool for university students and covert it into Art.

The design aethetic comes from Jordan Belson's Allures, to introduce a trance like idea my version of Blackboard is a display of thoughts instead of a display of Courses. It hones in on the idea of one's mind and different thoughts are portrayed in each tile that students are constantly in battle with. The website explores ideas of fast moving animations to mimic overthinking and spiraling but also has animations like perlin noise which introduce a more peaceful serenity to one's mind. 

The website was built solely using HTML and CSS along with p5.js for all sketches/animations.
